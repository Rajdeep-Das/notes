### Agile Principles
Scrum projects do not have an upfront analysis or design phase; all work occurs within the repeated cycle of sprints

**Organizational**

- Put the customer at the center
- Accept change
- Let the team self-organize
- Maintain a sustainable pace
- Produce minimal software
    - Produce minimal functionality
    - Produce only the product requested
    - Develop only code and tests

**Technical**

- Develop iteratively
    - Produce frequent working iterations
    - Freeze requirements during iterations
- Treat tests as a key resource
    - Do not start any new development until all tests pass
    - Test first
- Express requirements through scenarios
