Web Development
===============

**ECMAScript**: ECMAScript trademarked scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International. It was based on JavaScript, which now tracks ECMAScript. It is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web.

ECMAScript is supported in many applications, especially Web browsers, where it is implemented by JavaScript, or, in the case of Internet Explorer, JScript.

Latest edition as of 10/15/2016 is 6, ES6 or ECMAScript 2015.
